Task:
    Write function, which behaves almost exactly like the original split() method:
    - it should accept exactly one argument - a string,
    - it should return a list of words created from the string, divided in the places where the string contains whitespaces,
    - if the string is empty, the function should return an empty list,
    - its name should be mysplit().
