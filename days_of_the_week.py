"""
    Program is an implementation of a class called Weeker. This name comes from the fact that objects of that class are able to store and manipulate the days
    of the week. The class constructor accepts one argument â€“ a string. The string represents the name of the day of the week and the only acceptable values
    must come from the following set:
    - Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun.
    Invoking the constructor with an argument from outside this set will raise the WeekDayError exception.
    The class provides the following facilities:
    - objects of the class are "printable", i.e. they are able to implicitly convert themselves into strings,
    - the class is equipped with one-parameter methods called add_days(n) and subtract_days(n), with n being an integer number.
